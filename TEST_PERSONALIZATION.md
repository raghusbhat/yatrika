# Personalization System Test Guide

## üö® **Issues Fixed**

### 1. **Intent Classification Improved**

- **Problem**: "relax" was classified as "other" instead of "travel"
- **Solution**: Enhanced intent detection with better examples and context
- **Test**: Try inputs like "relax", "adventure", "culture", "food" - should all be classified as "travel"

### 2. **Gemini API Quota Management**

- **Problem**: Hitting rate limits on gemini-1.5-pro
- **Solution**:
  - Switched to gemini-1.5-flash (higher quota)
  - Added fallback template-based personalization
  - Simplified prompts to reduce token usage
- **Test**: Should handle quota exceeded errors gracefully

### 3. **Enhanced Error Handling**

- **Problem**: Personalization failures causing poor user experience
- **Solution**:
  - Graceful fallback to template-based responses
  - Better error metadata and logging
  - Profile completeness scoring
- **Test**: Should work even when API fails

## üß™ **Test Scenarios**

### **Test 1: Travel Interest Classification**

```bash
# Input: "relax"
# Expected: Should be classified as "travel" and accepted
# Previous: Was classified as "other" and rejected
```

### **Test 2: Profile-Based Personalization**

```bash
# Setup: User with Indian locale (IN) and family group
# Input: Any travel request
# Expected: Response should mention "As a fellow Indian traveler" and family-specific suggestions
```

### **Test 3: Quota Exceeded Fallback**

```bash
# Scenario: When Gemini API quota is exceeded
# Expected: Should fall back to template-based personalization
# Response should include personalization metadata with fallbackUsed: true
```

### **Test 4: Low Profile Completeness**

```bash
# Setup: User with minimal profile data
# Expected: Should use basic clarification without personalization overhead
# Metadata should indicate "insufficient_profile_data"
```

## üîç **What to Look For**

### **Successful Intent Classification**

```javascript
// In logs, you should see:
[runClarificationGraph] Gemini intent detection result: 'travel'
// Instead of:
[runClarificationGraph] Intent is not travel. Rejecting with message.
```

### **Successful Personalization**

```javascript
// In response metadata:
{
  "personalization": {
    "applied": true,
    "profileCompleteness": 0.4,
    "personalizations": ["cultural-context", "travel-preferences"],
    "fallbackUsed": false
  }
}
```

### **Graceful Fallback**

```javascript
// When API quota exceeded:
{
  "personalization": {
    "applied": false,
    "profileCompleteness": 0.4,
    "personalizations": [],
    "fallbackUsed": true,
    "error": "API quota exceeded - using standard response"
  }
}
```

## üéØ **Expected Improvements**

1. **Better Intent Recognition**: Travel-related terms like "relax", "adventure" are correctly identified
2. **Quota Resilience**: System continues working even when API limits are hit
3. **Smart Fallbacks**: Template-based personalization when AI fails
4. **Profile Awareness**: Only applies heavy personalization when user has sufficient profile data
5. **Clear Metadata**: Frontend receives clear information about personalization status

## üöÄ **Ready to Test**

The system should now:

- ‚úÖ Properly classify travel interests like "relax"
- ‚úÖ Handle API quota limits gracefully
- ‚úÖ Provide template-based fallback personalization
- ‚úÖ Give clear feedback about personalization status
- ‚úÖ Work efficiently with both complete and incomplete user profiles

Try the same flow again:

1. Enter travel details in the form
2. When asked for interests, type "relax"
3. Should now be accepted and processed with personalization!
